# IoT-Device-Integration-with-OLED-Display-and-BLE-Functionality
I designed and developed an IoT system using an ESP32 microcontroller to control an SSD1306 OLED display via BLE, enabling real-time text updates, image rendering, and scrolling functionalities. I integrated Wi-Fi to handle HTTP requests and process JSON-based data while optimizing system performance with Arduino libraries to ensure efficient resource management and low power consumption. Leveraging my expertise in microcontroller programming, data communication, and IoT system development, I created a reliable and responsive solution.
